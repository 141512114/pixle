# The Pixle Generator

This is the pixle generator. It is possible to generate new pixle lists by using the command `npm run pixles`.
It will create a json file inside the database folder. This json file contains all generated pixles.
To use this list delete the old pixle list and move the newly generated to the database folder inside the
app folder.

This should cover pretty much everything there is to it. The generated pixle lists won't be uploaded to
this repository. Don't want to spoil anything.
