# The Official Landing Page Of The Game _Pixle_

This is the landing page for the pixle project.

## First steps

Gulp has been removed and is no longer needed. Stylesheet generation is now handled by
Angular.

## Server Side Rendering

This project is built, so it runs on the server, effectively making it a normal, static webpage.\
To take benefit of this rendering technique, run the command `npm run start pixle-landing` to start the dev server.
If you want to just "prerender" the pixle landing page, `npm run build pixle-landing` does the job.
