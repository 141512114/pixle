            Pixle? What is that?

          <p class="description">
            Pixle is a very short and casual game which challenges its players with different puzzles each day.<br/>
            Puzzles are created out of a predefined pattern and a handful of randomly chosen emojis.
            Our puzzle generator mixes things up and spits out interesting and challenging puzzles, which are just
            seeking to be solved.<br/>
            Games like Wordle and Picross inspired the development of Pixle.
            It combines different aspects of its spiritual predecessors and improves the overall gameplay,
            effectively making it a compact and exciting mixture.
            Besides playing Pixle on your own, you can challenge your friends and family to these nerve-braking puzzles!<br/>
            Pixle is now available on the web and we challenge you to solve todays puzzle!

            Wondering how Pixle works? No worries, we will explain thoroughly.<br/>
            Below you can see a grid, which we also refer to as a "pixle". The pixle is
            a pattern consisting of up to five different emojis.

          <p class="description">
            So, the grid represents a pixle. You are shown the solution of the pixle once at the beginning
            and as soon as its hidden, you have to use your memory to rebuild it.<br/>
            Doesn't seem too difficult, right?

        <div class="col how-to-description mb-3">
          <p class="description">
            Everytime you place an emoji incorrectly, you lose a try on the mismatched tile.<br/>
            Don't worry, after each failed try, the pixle will flip and show the correct answers briefly.<br/>
            However, as soon as you run out of available tries on any tile, it's <span class="opensans-italic">game over</span>!

            About puzzles and pixles
          </h2>
          <p class="description">
            Puzzles, or pixles as we like to call them, are a fundamental part of the game Pixle.
            After all, the name "Pixle" derives from them.<br/>
            But more important: How are these pixles created? What is the pixle creation process?<br/>
            We built a small generator, which gets fed a few different, predefined patterns and a list of emojis.
            It chooses one random pattern out of the bunch and checks its requirements, which in this case would be
            the amount of emojis. Once it knows the correct amount,
            it randomly picks various emojis out of the list and makes sure double usage won't happen.
            After all, a pattern consisting of only red boxes wouldn't be as fun.<br/>
            A pattern and its emojis now have been chosen, it is time to throw them together and save in a list.
            A new pixle is born! Along with the pixle, other important information is stored in the list,
            such as the pixle id and publication date.<br/>
            And that should cover everything. Now you really know everything about the puzzles, pixles and the game
            Pixle.<br/>
