            Pixle is a very short and casual game which challenges its players with different puzzles each day.<br/>
            Puzzles are created out of a predefined pattern and randomly chosen emojis.
            Our pixle generator mixes things up and spits out interesting and challenging puzzles, which are just
            wanting to be solved. Their difficulty varies from being a three-by-three grid with just two emojis to being
            an up to five-by-five grid with five different emojis.<br/>
            Games like Wordle and Picross inspired the development of Pixle. It combines different aspects
            and improves these and the overall gameplay. Besides solving puzzles on your own, you can challenge
            your friends and family to these nerve-braking puzzles!<br/>
            Pixle is now available on the web and we challenge you to solve todays puzzle!

            Wondering how Pixle works? No worries, we will explain thoroughly.<br/>
            Below you can see a grid, which we also call a "pixle". The pixle is
            a pattern consisting of up to five different emojis.

            So, the grid represents a pixle. You are shown the solution of the pixle once at the beginning
            and as soon as its hidden, you have to use your memory to rebuild it.<br/>
            Doesn't seem too difficult, right?

            Everytime you place an emoji incorrectly, you lose a try on the mismatched tile.<br/>
            Don't worry, after each failed try, the pixle will flip and show the correct answers briefly.<br/>
            However, as soon as you run out of available tries, it's <span class="opensans-italic">game over</span>!

            About puzzles and pixles
          </h2>
          <p class="description">
            Puzzles, or pixles as we like to call them, are a fundamental part of the game Pixle.
            After all, the name "Pixle" derives from them.<br/>
            But we don't want to talk all day about this boring theoretical stuff.
            How are these pixles created? What is the process?<br/>
            We built a small generator, which gets fed a few different, predefined patterns and a list of emojis.
            It chooses one random pattern out of the bunch and checks its requirements, which in this case would be
            the amount of emojis needed to satisfy its needs.
            Once it knows the correct amount, it randomly picks various emojis out of the list and makes sure double
            usage
            won't happen. An emoji can only be used once in each pattern.<br/>
            A pattern and its emojis have been chosen, now it is time to throw them together and save in an array.
            A new pixle is born! Along with the pixle, other important information is stored in the array,
            such as the pixle id and publication date.<br/>
            And that should cover everything. Now you really know everything about the puzzles, pixles and the game
            Pixle.<br/>
